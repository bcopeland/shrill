PREREQUISITES

To use this application, you need to have Perl with the GTK2 bindings, 
including GladeXML, and a recent version of mserv (I use 0.35).  These are 
both probably available from your distribution.  In debian unstable: 

# apt-get install mserv libgtk2-perl libgtk2-gladexml

For the ogg_info.pl script in the tools directory, you will also need 
Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl (libogg-vorbis-header-pureperl-perl).

You should use some other tool to get the album art for your collection.
Shrill looks for the largest file with an extension of jpg, jpeg, png
or gif in a given album directory.

INSTALLATION

Shrill is installed via the usual perl installation methodology, viz.:

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ su
# make install

Now run:
$ shrill

This will create a new copy of the config file and store it in your
user directory (~/.shrill/config).  Edit it to suit, and then run shrill
once more to use the application.  

Refer to the README for more information.
